- Analysis on the distinction between SUPER HOST and NORMAL HOST on different dimensions like:  
    - Acceptance rate
    - Response rate 
    - Instant booking
    - Profile picture
    - Identity verification
    - Review scores 
    - Average number of bookings per month, etc.

- Analysis on how the comments of reviewers vary for listings of SUPER HOST vs. NORMAL HOST (by extracting words from the comments provided by the reviewers).

- Analysis on the average price and availability of the listings for the upcoming year between SUPER HOST and NORMAL HOST.

- Comparison between SUPER HOST vs NORMAL HOST for Large Property Listings.

- Comparing how the aforementioned tendencies differ between hosts who live close to their listed property and hosts who live elsewhere. 

- Obtaining meaningful insights through the use of Excel charts.
